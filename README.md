### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**thedhk/thedhk**

Consecutive progression as though bees fly thousands kilometers to support their species, 
tree make oxygen to breathe and to do their mission of life, 
and earth follows orbit of sun due to inevitable laws of nature.

Continuous discipline without a hesitation, not even have to make a principles and taboo, 
absolute passion of your life will lead you to the only one way.

Whatever I have spoken is going to happen no mater what happens.
Future is already existing and the prophecy is true entity.
We can see future through third eyes that we have to pursue to open it up, 
with intuitive human instinct and infinite knowledges of everything.
I describe it such like previous expression. 

For others who will not going to understand it,
I usually say it is a belief of myself that I can do whatever I say, whatever I intended, and whatever I planned.
This belief came from experience that I have it in my mind, I never fail, I always success as best as I can.
We can predict future precisely it could not have a bit of differences my expect and real. 
Then we can consider as the future is already existing, futhermore, we can also be a prophet of yourself.
